# Streamlit AutoML Application

Welcome to the Streamlit AutoML Application! This application is designed to simplify and streamline the process of building, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models using PyCaret and Pandas-Profiling. With this user-friendly interface, you can quickly and effortlessly perform data analysis, model training, and prediction tasks.

## Application Link
You can access the application online by following this link: [Streamlit AutoML Application](https://app-automl-application-5svqmxkkhppvh8rf9g4xak.streamlit.app/)

## Features
- **Data Import**: Upload your dataset or connect to external data sources to start your machine learning project.
- **Data Analysis**: Use Pandas-Profiling to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and gain insights into your data.
- **AutoML**: PyCaret integration enables you to perform automated machine learning, including feature selection, model training, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of multiple machine learning models using various metrics and visualizations.
- **Prediction**: Make predictions on new data or test the model's performance on a holdout dataset.
- **Model Deployment**: Deploy your trained machine learning model for real-world use cases.
